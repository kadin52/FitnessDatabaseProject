# Contributions

This project is from a collaborative group school project with 3 others. 

I handled all PHP code including form submissions, displaying the tables for the user, and everything in the SQL script but the stored procedures and populating the database. I did not handle the Bootstrap portion, some of the Javascript functionality, and some of the web-styling.
